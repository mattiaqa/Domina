# Domina

Domina is a project realised during the first year at Ca' Foscari University, required as a project for the programming and laboratory exam.

## Description

The project consisted of creating the class 'player.cpp' which was to simulate some clever strategy in order to create an executable that would play draughts automatically.

## Implemented Strategy

I chose to use a pseudo-random strategy in order to avoid stalemates during the game. 
I write pseudo-random because I have decided to implement a system that creates a sort of prioritisation with moves that can potentially bring the game to a more advanced state, prioritising the movement of dames or pieces that can eliminate opposing pieces.
